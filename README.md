## Calendar example 

Hi! 

I leave available my method to create a calendar that can be displayed in your game, and update with a simple command. 

You can download [CalendarExample](CalendarExample/) and add it to your Renpy directory, you will have a little example set to show you how to set it up. 

If you don't need it, you have [shortcut.rpy](CalendarExample/shortcut.rpy) which contains a quick example of the script.
